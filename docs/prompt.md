2. When receiving user feedback, if feedback content is not empty, must call MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced again and adjust behavior based on feedback.
3. Only when user explicitly indicates "end" or "no more interaction needed" can you stop calling MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced, then the process is complete.
4. Unless receiving end command, all steps must repeatedly call MCP mcp-feedback-enhanced.
